# Portfolio Genetic Optimizer


This project uses genetic algorithms for portfolio optimization with assets from the Brazilian stock exchange (B3). The evolutionary approach helps find the ideal combination of weights that maximize the Sharpe Ratio, balancing return and risk.

## Features

* Data collection directly from Yahoo Finance for Brazilian assets.

* Calculation of returns and covariance matrix.

* Genetic Algorithm for optimization:

* Random initialization of portfolios.

* Selection of top-performing candidates.

* Crossover and mutation with constraints to prevent negative weights.

* Graphical visualization of the asset distribution in the optimized portfolio.
